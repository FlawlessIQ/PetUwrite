# State Insurance Licensing Checklist

**Purpose:** Guide for expanding PetUwrite pet insurance services to all 50 US states

**Last Updated:** [INSERT DATE]

---

## Overview

Pet insurance is regulated at the **state level** in the United States. Each state has its own Department of Insurance (or equivalent) that oversees insurance licensing, product approvals, and rate filings.

**PetUwrite's Business Model:**
- We are a **technology platform**, NOT an insurance company
- We facilitate connections between pet owners and licensed insurance carriers
- Insurance policies are underwritten by [INSERT LICENSED CARRIER NAME]

**Licensing Strategy:**
- **Option 1**: Partner with a nationally licensed insurance carrier (simplest)
- **Option 2**: Obtain Managing General Agent (MGA) license in each state (complex)
- **Option 3**: Operate as a marketing platform with no direct insurance transactions (minimal licensing)

**Recommended Approach:** Partner with a licensed carrier and obtain producer/agent licenses only where required.

## Reciprocity and Multi-State Licensing

- **Benefit**: Apply for multiple state licenses through one portal
- **Cost**: $25-$50 per state application via NIPR

### Resident vs. Non-Resident Licenses
- **Resident License**: State where you maintain your primary business
- **Non-Resident License**: All other states (often easier to obtain if you have a resident license)
- **Reciprocity**: Many states have agreements to fast-track non-resident applications

### Recommended Strategy:
1. Obtain **resident license** in your home state (e.g., [INSERT STATE])
2. Use reciprocity to obtain **non-resident licenses** in Tier 1 states
3. Leverage NIPR to apply for remaining states in batches

---

## Product Approval Requirements

In addition to licensing, **insurance products** (policy forms, rates) must be approved by each state.

### Form Filing
- **Who Files**: The licensed insurance carrier
- **What's Filed**: Policy forms, endorsements, rates, marketing materials
- **Review Time**: 30-90 days per state
- **Cost**: $100-$500 per state filing

### Rate Filing
- **Who Files**: The carrier
- **Requirements**: Actuarial justification for premium rates
- **Approval**: Some states require prior approval; others allow "file and use"

**PetUwrite's Role**: Work with carrier partner to ensure products are approved in all states where we operate.

## Compliance Requirements (Post-Licensing)

### 1. Continuing Education (CE)
- **Frequency**: Every 2 years (most states)

- **Requirements**: Pay renewal fee, complete CE, maintain E&O insurance
- **Late Renewal**: Penalties or reinstatement requirements

### 3. Errors & Omissions (E&O) Insurance

## Alternative Licensing Model: Carrier Partnership

### Option: No Direct Licensing
If PetUwrite operates purely as a **technology vendor** to a licensed carrier:
- **Licensing**: Carrier handles all insurance licensing
- **Underwriting**: Carrier makes all underwriting decisions
- **Claims**: Carrier processes all claims
- **PetUwrite Role**: Quote engine, AI risk scoring, platform provider
- **Benefit**: No state-by-state licensing burden
- **Drawback**: Less control over underwriting, lower margins

### Legal Structure:
- **Master Service Agreement (MSA)**: Contract between PetUwrite and carrier
- **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**: GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Vendor Agreement**: Technology services only, no insurance transactions

**Recommendation**: Explore this model with [INSERT CARRIER NAME] to minimize regulatory burden.
