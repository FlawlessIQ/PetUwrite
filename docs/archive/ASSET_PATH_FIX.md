# 🔧 Asset Path Fix - RESOLVED

**Issue:** App wouldn't run due to missing logo files at incorrect path
**Error:** `No file or variants found for asset: build/flutter_assets/PetUwrite%20navy%20background.png`

## ❌ Problem

The asset paths were pointing to `build/flutter_assets/` which is:
1. The **output** directory where Flutter compiles assets (not source)
2. Looking for files with spaces in names (encoded as `%20`)
3. Files didn't exist at all yet

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Created Proper Assets Directory
```bash
mkdir -p assets/
```

### 2. Updated Asset Paths in Code
**File:** `lib/theme/petuwrite_theme.dart`

Changed from:
```dart
static const String logoNavyBackground = 'build/flutter_assets/PetUwrite navy background.png';
static const String logoTransparent = 'build/flutter_assets/PetUwrite transparent.png';
```

Changed to:
```dart
static const String logoNavyBackground = 'assets/petuwrite_logo_navy.svg';
static const String logoTransparent = 'assets/petuwrite_logo_transparent.svg';
```

### 3. Updated pubspec.yaml
**File:** `pubspec.yaml`

Changed from:
```yaml
assets:
  - .env
  - build/flutter_assets/PetUwrite navy background.png
  - build/flutter_assets/PetUwrite transparent.png
```

Changed to:
```yaml
assets:
  - .env
  - assets/
```

### 4. Created Placeholder SVG Logos
Created two temporary SVG placeholder files:
- ✅ `assets/petuwrite_logo_navy.svg` - Navy background with teal branding
- ✅ `assets/petuwrite_logo_transparent.svg` - Transparent logo with PW initials

These are **temporary placeholders** with PetUwrite brand colors (Navy #0A2647, Teal #00C2CB, Sky #A8E6E8).

## 📂 Correct Directory Structure

```
PetUwrite/
├── assets/                              ← Source assets folder
│   ├── petuwrite_logo_navy.svg         ← Placeholder logo
│   └── petuwrite_logo_transparent.svg  ← Placeholder logo
├── fonts/                               ← Font files
│   ├── Poppins/
│   └── Inter/
└── pubspec.yaml                         ← Asset registration
```

**Note:** `build/` directory is auto-generated by Flutter and should NOT contain source files.

## 🎨 Placeholder Logo Details

### Navy Background Logo (512x512)
- Navy background (#0A2647)
- Teal text "PetUwrite" (#00C2CB)
- Sky tagline (#A8E6E8)
- Decorative circles

### Transparent Logo (256x256)
- Transparent background
- Teal outer circle (#00C2CB)
- Navy inner circle (#0A2647)
- Sky accent ring (#A8E6E8)
- "PW" initials

## 🚀 App Should Now Run

Try running the app:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

The app will now run with placeholder SVG logos in brand colors.

## 🎯 Next Steps - Replace Placeholders

When you have your actual logo files:

1. **Add PNG logo files** to `assets/` directory:
   ```
   assets/petuwrite_logo_navy.png
   assets/petuwrite_logo_transparent.png
   ```

2. **Update the paths** in `lib/theme/petuwrite_theme.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String logoNavyBackground = 'assets/petuwrite_logo_navy.png';
   static const String logoTransparent = 'assets/petuwrite_logo_transparent.png';
   ```

3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## 📝 Key Lessons

✅ **DO:** Store source assets in `assets/` folder
✅ **DO:** Use `assets/` in pubspec.yaml to include entire folder
✅ **DO:** Avoid spaces in asset filenames (use underscores)

❌ **DON'T:** Store assets in `build/` directory
❌ **DON'T:** Point to `build/flutter_assets/` in code
❌ **DON'T:** Use spaces in filenames

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - App can now run with placeholder logos
**Next:** Replace SVG placeholders with actual PNG logo files when ready
