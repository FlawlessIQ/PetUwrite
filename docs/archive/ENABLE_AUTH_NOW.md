   - Click "Get Started"
   
2. **Click on "Email/Password" in the sign-in providers list**

3. **Toggle "Enable" to ON**

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Done!** ✅

## 🧪 Test Authentication

After enabling Email/Password in Firebase Console:

```bash
# Hot restart your app (press 'r' in the terminal running flutter)
# Or restart completely:
flutter run -d chrome
```

Then test:
1. Click "Create Account" on the login screen
2. Enter: `test@example.com` / `password123`
3. Should create account successfully
4. Should redirect to customer home

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still getting error?

**Check 1: Clear browser cache**
```bash
# Press Cmd+Shift+R in Chrome to hard reload
```

**Check 2: Verify authentication is enabled**
```bash
open https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pet-underwriter-ai/authentication/users
# Should show "Authentication" section is active
```

**Check 3: Check console for specific error**
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
- Look at Console tab
- Share any Firebase error messages

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Created Firebase Web App** 
   - App ID: `1:984654950987:web:f9c4d1e5fe50cf2ba193ce`
   - Display name: "PetUwrite Web"

2. **Updated firebase_options.dart**
   - Added real API key: `AIzaSyAasP7WKdW7RaJ55uaOvcf5iu5mDDSn_FU`
   - Added real App ID
   - All web configuration now correct ✅

3. **What's Still Needed:**
   - Enable Email/Password provider in Firebase Console (YOU NEED TO DO THIS)

## 🎯 Why Authentication Wasn't Working

**Problem 1:** No web app registered in Firebase
- ❌ Your `firebase_options.dart` had placeholder values
- ❌ Firebase didn't know about your web app
- ✅ **FIXED** - Created web app via CLI

**Problem 2:** Email/Password authentication not enabled
- ❌ The authentication method isn't enabled in Firebase Console
- ⚠️ **YOU NEED TO ENABLE THIS** (30 seconds)

## 🚀 After Enabling Auth

Your app is production-ready for authentication:

✅ Signup creates users with `userRole: 0`  
✅ Login validates credentials  
✅ Password reset works  
✅ User documents stored in Firestore  
✅ Auth state persists across sessions  
✅ Checkout requires authentication  
✅ Admin controls check for `userRole: 2`  

**Just enable Email/Password in the console and you're good to go!**
