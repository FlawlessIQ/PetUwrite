# Homepage Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Created

### New Homepage Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/homepage.dart`

A beautiful landing page featuring:
- **Navy background** (matching brand color `kPrimaryNavy`)
- **Large prominent logo** centered at top (using `assets/PetUwrite transparent.png`)
- **App name and tagline** prominently displayed
- **Three action cards:**
  1. **Get a Quote** - Links to conversational quote flow
  2. **File a Claim** - Placeholder for future claims feature
  3. **Sign In** - Links to authentication
- **Footer** with copyright and links (Terms, Privacy, Contact)
- **Fully responsive** design (adapts to mobile and desktop)

### Routing Updates
**File:** `lib/main.dart`

Updated routing configuration:
- **Initial route:** `Homepage()` (was `ConversationalQuoteFlow()`)
- **New route:** `/home` → Homepage
- **Existing routes maintained:**
  - `/conversational-quote` → Quote flow
  - `/auth-gate` → Sign in
  - `/plan-selection` → Plan selection
  - `/confirmation` → Policy confirmation
  - All other routes unchanged

## 🎨 Color Scheme

The homepage uses:
- **Background:** Navy (`kPrimaryNavy` #0A2647)
- **Card 1 (Get Quote):** Teal gradient (primary action)
- **Card 2 (File Claim):** Sky blue gradient (secondary action)
- **Card 3 (Sign In):** Dark navy gradient (tertiary action)
- **Text:** White with accent sky for tagline
- **Footer:** Muted grey text with sky links

## 🚀 User Flow

```
