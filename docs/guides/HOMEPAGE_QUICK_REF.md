## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Background Color

decoration: const BoxDecoration(
  color: PetUwriteColors.kPrimaryNavy,  // Change this
),
```

### Change Logo Size
```dart
// In homepage.dart, line ~78
constraints: BoxConstraints(
  maxWidth: isSmallScreen ? 280 : 400,   // Adjust these
  maxHeight: isSmallScreen ? 280 : 400,
),
```

### Change Card Order
```dart
// In homepage.dart, line ~118
// Reorder these three _buildActionCard() calls
// First card appears at top, last card at bottom
```

### Add New Action Card
```dart
// In homepage.dart, after line ~170, add:
const SizedBox(height: 24),
_buildActionCard(
  context: context,
  icon: Icons.help_outline,
  title: 'Help Center',
  subtitle: 'Get support and answers',
  gradient: LinearGradient(...),
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/help');
  },
),
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing
**Issue:** Image.asset can't find logo  
**Fix:** Verify `assets/PetUwrite transparent.png` exists  
**Check:** pubspec.yaml includes assets folder

### Cards Not Clickable
**Issue:** InkWell not responding  
**Fix:** Ensure Material widget wraps InkWell  
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented correctly

### Wrong Initial Screen
**Issue:** App still shows quote flow first  
**Fix:** Hot restart (not hot reload) - `r` key in terminal  
**Or:** Stop and run `flutter run` again

### Routing Error
**Issue:** "Could not find route /conversational-quote"  
**Fix:** Check main.dart routes map includes the route  
**Status:** ✅ All routes properly configured
