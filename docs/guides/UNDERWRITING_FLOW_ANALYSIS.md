```

## ❌ The Problem

### Question 9: Pre-existing Conditions
```dart
QuestionData(
  id: 'preExisting',
  question: "Does {petName} have any pre-existing health conditions?",
  type: QuestionType.choice,
  field: 'hasPreExistingConditions',
  options: [
    ChoiceOption(value: false, label: 'No', icon: Icons.check_circle),
    ChoiceOption(value: true, label: 'Yes', icon: Icons.warning),
  ],
),
```

**Issue:** This is a **YES/NO** question with **NO follow-up**!

### What's Missing:
- ❌ No question asking **WHICH** conditions
- ❌ No details about **WHEN** diagnosed
- ❌ No information about **TREATMENT** status
- ❌ No option to upload **VET RECORDS**
- ❌ No detailed **MEDICAL HISTORY**

### Result:
The pet object is created with:
```dart
preExistingConditions: _answers['hasPreExistingConditions'] == true 
    ? ['Pre-existing condition reported']  // ⚠️ Generic placeholder!
    : [],
```

This means:
- Risk scoring uses generic "has conditions" flag
- No specific condition data for underwriting
- No way to exclude specific conditions
- No medical records for AI analysis

---

## 🎯 Where Detailed Underwriting Should Be

### Option 1: In Quote Flow (Recommended)
**Add conditional follow-up questions:**

```
9. Pre-existing        → "Any pre-existing conditions?"
                          ↓ IF YES
9a. Condition Types    → "Which conditions?" (multi-select)
                          - Allergies
                          - Arthritis
                          - Cancer (history)
                          - Diabetes
                          - Heart disease
                          - Hip dysplasia
                          - Kidney disease
                          - Skin conditions
                          - Other (specify)
                          ↓
9b. Condition Details  → For each condition:
                          "When was {condition} diagnosed?"
                          "Is it currently being treated?"
                          "What medications?"
                          ↓
9c. Vet Records        → "Upload vet records? (Optional)"
                          [Upload Button]
```

### Option 2: In Checkout Review Step
**Add medical questionnaire before owner details:**

```
CHECKOUT FLOW:
  Step 1: Review Quote      → See pet/plan summary
            ↓ IF has pre-existing
          [Medical Questionnaire Button]
            ↓
  Step 1.5: Medical Details → Detailed underwriting form
  Step 2: Owner Details     → Contact info
  Step 3: Payment           → Card details
  Step 4: Confirmation      → Done
```

### Option 3: After Quote, Before Plans
**Insert underwriting screen:**

```
Quote Flow → AI Analysis → 🆕 UNDERWRITING → Plan Selection → Checkout
```

## 🏗️ Recommended Implementation

### Best Approach: **Option 1 + Option 3**

**Why:**
1. **Gather basic info in quote flow** (lightweight, conditional)
   - If "Yes" to pre-existing → ask for types
   - Keep it conversational (3-4 quick follow-ups)
   
2. **Detailed underwriting AFTER AI analysis** (comprehensive)
   - Full medical questionnaire
   - Vet record upload
   - Review AI-detected risk factors
   - Allow user to provide context

**Flow:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. CONVERSATIONAL QUOTE (Quick Questions)                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   - Basic pet info
   - "Any pre-existing?" → YES/NO
   - IF YES: "Which types?" (quick multi-select)
                ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. AI RISK ANALYSIS                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   - Analyzes breed, age, basic conditions
   - Calculates preliminary risk score
                ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. 🆕 DETAILED UNDERWRITING (If high risk or conditions)   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   - Full medical history form
   - Condition details (diagnosis dates, treatments)
   - Medication list
   - Vet record upload
   - AI analysis of records
                ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4. PLAN SELECTION (with underwriting results)             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   - Shows available plans
   - Displays exclusions based on underwriting
   - Explains coverage limitations
                ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 5. CHECKOUT                                                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📋 What Needs to Be Built

### 1. Enhanced Quote Flow Questions
**File:** `lib/screens/conversational_quote_flow.dart`

Add after pre-existing question:
```dart
// Conditional follow-up if hasPreExistingConditions == true
QuestionData(
  id: 'conditionTypes',
  question: "What conditions does {petName} have? Select all that apply.",
  type: QuestionType.multiSelect,
  field: 'preExistingConditionTypes',
  condition: (answers) => answers['hasPreExistingConditions'] == true,
  options: [
    'Allergies',
    'Arthritis',
    'Cancer (history)',
    'Diabetes',
    'Heart Disease',
    'Hip Dysplasia',
    'Kidney Disease',
    'Skin Conditions',
    'Other',
  ],
),
```

### 2. Detailed Underwriting Screen
**New File:** `lib/screens/medical_underwriting_screen.dart`

Features:
- Full medical history form
- Condition-specific questions
- Medication/treatment tracking
- Vet record upload (PDF/image)
- AI-powered record parsing
- Review and confirmation

### 3. Updated Pet Model
**File:** `lib/models/pet.dart`

Add fields:
```dart
class Pet {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // Enhanced medical history
  final List<MedicalCondition> medicalConditions;
  final List<Medication> medications;
  final List<String> allergies;
  final List<VetVisit> vetHistory;
  final VetRecords? uploadedRecords;
  
  // ...
}

class MedicalCondition {
  final String name;
  final DateTime diagnosisDate;
  final String status; // 'active', 'resolved', 'managed'
  final String? treatment;
  final String? notes;
}
```

### 4. Admin Review Integration
**File:** `lib/screens/admin_dashboard.dart`

Add to quote review:
- View complete medical history
- See uploaded vet records
- AI-parsed condition summary
- Approve/deny based on underwriting
- Set condition-specific exclusions

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### Current (Inadequate):
```
User: "Does Max have pre-existing conditions?"
App:  [Yes] [No]
User: *clicks Yes*
App:  "Great! What's your email?" ❌ WAIT, WHAT?!
```

### Improved:
```
User: "Does Max have pre-existing conditions?"
App:  [Yes] [No]
User: *clicks Yes*
App:  "Which conditions does Max have?"
      □ Allergies
      □ Arthritis
      □ Hip Dysplasia ← User checks this
      □ Other
User: *selects Hip Dysplasia*
App:  "When was Max diagnosed with Hip Dysplasia?"
User: "2 years ago"
App:  "Is it currently being treated?"
User: "Yes, with pain medication"
App:  "Great! We'll factor this into your coverage options."
```

## 🚨 Impact of Current Gap

### For Underwriting:
- ❌ Can't properly assess risk

- ❌ Poor trust/reputation

### For Business:
- ❌ Adverse selection (high-risk pets not properly priced)
- ❌ Higher claim rates than expected
- ❌ Potential for fraud
- ❌ Legal/regulatory risk
