# Firestore Security Rules Documentation

## 🔐 Overview

This document describes the Firebase Firestore security rules for the Clovara application, including role-based access control and data protection policies.

---

## 👥 User Roles

### Role Levels
- **0** = Regular User (Customer)
- **1** = Underwriter (Review Access)
- **2** = Admin (Full Access)

**Storage Location:** `users/{uid}/userRole`

---

## 🛠️ Helper Functions

### `isAuthenticated()`
**Purpose:** Check if user is logged in  
**Returns:** `true` if user has valid Firebase Auth session

```javascript
function isAuthenticated() {
  return request.auth != null;
}
```

---

### `isOwner(userId)`
**Purpose:** Check if authenticated user matches the specified user ID  
**Returns:** `true` if request.auth.uid equals userId

```javascript
function isOwner(userId) {
  return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

---

### `isOwnDocument()`
**Purpose:** Check if user owns the document being accessed  
**Returns:** `true` if document's userId field matches authenticated user

```javascript
function isOwnDocument() {
  return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

---

### `isAdmin()`
**Purpose:** Check if user has admin privileges (userRole == 2)  
**Returns:** `true` if user's userRole field equals 2

```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.userRole == 2;
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
allow write: if isAdmin();
```

## 🔒 Security Patterns

### Pattern 1: Owner-Only Access
**Use Case:** User accessing their own data

```javascript
match /collection/{docId} {
  allow read, write: if resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

**Example:** pets, quotes, policies

---

### Pattern 2: Admin Override
**Use Case:** Admin reviewing/overriding user data

```javascript
match /collection/{docId} {
  allow read: if resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin();
  allow update: if isAdmin() && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly([
    'fieldAllowedToChange'
  ]);
}
```

**Example:** quotes collection (eligibility override)

---

### Pattern 3: Read-Only for Users
**Use Case:** Data written by backend, readable by users

```javascript
match /collection/{docId} {
  allow read: if resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
  allow write: if false; // Only backend/Cloud Functions
}
```

**Example:** risk_score subcollection, payments

---

### Pattern 4: Admin Settings
**Use Case:** Configuration readable by all, writable by admins

```javascript
match /admin_settings/{document} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow write: if isAdmin();
}
```

**Example:** underwriting_rules

---

### Pattern 5: Immutable Audit Logs
**Use Case:** Write-once, read-only logs

```javascript
match /audit_logs/{logId} {
  allow read, create: if isAdmin();
  allow update, delete: if false;
}
```

**Example:** audit_logs collection

## 🧪 Testing Security Rules

### Test 1: Regular User Access
```javascript
// User can read their own quote
✅ user1 → read quotes/quote_owned_by_user1 → ALLOW

// User cannot read another user's quote
❌ user1 → read quotes/quote_owned_by_user2 → DENY

// User cannot update another user's quote
❌ user1 → update quotes/quote_owned_by_user2 → DENY
```

---

### Test 2: Admin Access
```javascript
// Admin can read any quote
✅ admin → read quotes/any_quote → ALLOW

// Admin can override eligibility
✅ admin → update quotes/any_quote.humanOverride → ALLOW

// Admin cannot modify pet data directly
❌ admin → update quotes/any_quote.pet.name → DENY
```

---

### Test 3: Underwriting Rules
```javascript
// Authenticated user can read rules
✅ user → read admin_settings/underwriting_rules → ALLOW

// Regular user cannot write rules
❌ user → update admin_settings/underwriting_rules → DENY

// Admin can write rules
✅ admin → update admin_settings/underwriting_rules → ALLOW
```

---

### Test 4: Audit Logs
```javascript
// Regular user cannot read audit logs
❌ user → read audit_logs/any_log → DENY

// Admin can create audit log
✅ admin → create audit_logs/new_log → ALLOW

// Admin cannot update existing log
❌ admin → update audit_logs/existing_log → DENY

// Admin cannot delete log
❌ admin → delete audit_logs/existing_log → DENY
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy Rules to Firebase
```bash
# Preview changes
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --dry-run

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# View deployed rules
firebase firestore:rules get
```

---

### Test Rules in Console
1. Navigate to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
2. Click **"Rules Playground"**
3. Select collection and operation
4. Set authenticated user UID
5. Click **"Run"** to test

---

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission Denied" Error
**Cause:** User lacks required role or ownership  
**Solution:** 
- Check `userRole` field in users collection
- Verify `ownerId` matches authenticated user
- Ensure user is logged in (`request.auth != null`)

---

### Issue 2: Admin Cannot Update Quote
**Cause:** Trying to update non-allowed fields  
**Solution:**
- Only update allowed fields (humanOverride, eligibility.status, etc.)
- Check `affectedKeys()` whitelist in rules

---

### Issue 3: Rules Not Updating
**Cause:** Deployment failed or cached rules  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Force redeploy
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --force

# Clear local cache
firebase logout
firebase login
```

---

### Issue 4: User Can't Read Underwriting Rules
**Cause:** User not authenticated  
**Solution:**
- Ensure Firebase Auth session is valid
- Check `request.auth != null` returns true

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Rule Evaluation Cost
Each security rule evaluation counts toward Firestore read operations.

**Optimization Tips:**
1. **Cache User Role:** Store `userRole` in client after login
2. **Minimize `get()` Calls:** Each `get()` in rules = 1 read operation
3. **Use Subcollections:** Reduce need for complex queries
4. **Client-Side Validation:** Validate before sending request

**Example:**
```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Multiple get() calls per request
allow read: if get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.userRole == 2
            && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/settings/config).data.enabled == true;

// ✅ GOOD - Single get() call
allow read: if isAdmin(); // Uses helper function with single get()
```

---

## 🔐 Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- ✅ Grant minimum necessary permissions
- ✅ Use owner-based access by default
- ✅ Require admin role for sensitive operations

### 2. Defense in Depth
- ✅ Validate on client side
- ✅ Enforce with security rules
- ✅ Validate again on server (Cloud Functions)

### 3. Immutable Audit Trails
- ✅ Never allow updates to audit logs
- ✅ Never allow deletes to audit logs
- ✅ Log all admin actions

### 4. Field-Level Restrictions
- ✅ Use `affectedKeys()` to limit admin updates
- ✅ Prevent modification of critical fields
- ✅ Preserve original data for audit

### 5. Role-Based Access Control
- ✅ Use helper functions (`isAdmin()`)
- ✅ Store roles in user document
- ✅ Validate roles before granting access
